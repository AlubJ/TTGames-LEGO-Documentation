Getting Started
============

Each LEGO Game made by TTGames is ever so slightly different from eachother but the one thing that remains consistent with all of them is the use of archive files. These archive files are used to contain all of the games assets (sometimes with compression) so the game can easily access them without the constraints of the Windows file system.
